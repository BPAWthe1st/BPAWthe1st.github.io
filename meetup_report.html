                I attended the <a href=https://www.meetup.com/Hack-and-Learn/events/277389258> Should You Learn to Code?</a> event that was put on by the <a href=https://www.meetup.com/Hack-and-Learn> Hack and Learn</a> group. This event provided an overview of the decisions to take into account when deciding whether to get into coding and also recommended career paths should you decide to code. The presenters were very energetic and engaging as well as knowledgeable about the subject matter. They were very helpful in answering questions that branched off from their core presentation. I came away with a good sense of the avenues that I could go with my coding career and the next steps to take to get started.

            <p>
            The group meets puts this same event on about once a month and they also offer some more in depth events that dive into a particular coding topic, including an intro to HTML and CSS event that I was unfortunately not able to attend. They are not focused soley on web development, but offer events in all different aspects of coding, which I appreciate. Their goal is to help people learn all the various use cases for coding and build a personal roadmap for getting started.
