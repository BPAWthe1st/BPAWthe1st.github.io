            Hello, I am Brendan Williams, a student in CNIT-132 (Intermediate HTML). I am working towards the Web Application Developer certificate at CCSF in the hopes of pivoting my career to be more software developer oriented. I am originally from Philadelphia, PA and went to school for Electrical Engineering, but spent most of my career as a Program Manager.
            </p>

            <p>
            I am taking HTML courses as a foundation for getting into PHP and JavaScript to do web app development. I dabbled in HTML during my Intro to Programming class during my undergrad and then again a few years later through a Udacity course, but wanted to learn more formally. One of my favorite websites and one that actually got me interested in web development is <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a> and all of its affiliated  web apps. The move from programs installed on your local computer to web based apps that can be used anywhere yet retain your information was fascinating to me. I got hooked on programming learn to do for local programs, I am now looking to get  better at web app programming.
            </p>

            <p>
            As I started learning about web development, it was interesting to read about the history of the interent and how things changed following the burst of the dotcom bubble. The <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/2/31579/networks/a-brief-history-of-web-development#the-turn-of-the-century" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">years that followed</a> saw an explosion of new ideas and use cases, and I feel like there is still a lot of potential in the online world.
