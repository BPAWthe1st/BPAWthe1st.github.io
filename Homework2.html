        <ul>
            <li>Choose a keyword that your audience with currently associates with your brand or you want them to associate with your brand</li>
            <li>Use that keyword early on in your website (near the top and preferably in a header)</li>
            <li>If you are using multiple keywords, only use one keyword per title.</li>
            <li>Understand your competitors' use of keywords to design your site better (sites like <a href="http://www.keywordspy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keyword Spy</a> can help provide this insight.)</li>
            <li>If you intend to use social media, add meta tags optimized designed for social media sites to ID key content from your site</li>
            <li>Ensure your site has responsive loading times (checkout Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PageSpeed Insights Tool</a>)</li>
            <li>Use internal links to establish an information hierarchy for your website and also help Google get a deeper understanding of the content on your page</li>
        </ul>
